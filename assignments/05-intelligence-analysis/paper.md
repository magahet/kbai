## Introduction

We will be designing an AI agent that uses frames which represent actions of individuals and determines if those people are conducting, or planning to conduct, illegal activity. Our working set of examples is show here:

    (Bought (JaneDoe, icecream, Atlanta, Tuesday, cash))
    (Ate (JaneDoe, icecream, Atlanta, Tuesday, spoon))
    (Videotaped (TidMarsh, bank, Atlanta, Thursday, video-camera))
    (Bought (TidMarsh, gun, Atlanta, Monday, credit-card))
    (Stole (TidMarsh, car, Atlanta, Friday, ...))
    (Drove (JaneDoe, car, Atlanta, Tuesday, ...))
    (Drove (TidMarsh, car, Atlanta, Friday, ...))
